**The primary difference between the list sort() function and the sorted() function
is that the sort() function will modify the list it is called on. The sorted() function
will create a new list containing a sorted version of the list it is given. The sorted()
function will not modify the list passed as a parameter. If you want to sort a list but
still have the original unsorted version, then you would use the sorted() function.
If maintaining the original order of the list is unimportant, then you can call
the sort() function on the list.


**The reverse() method edits the list to be in a reversed order. However, reversed()
method takes a list and returns an iterator of it in reverse order.
